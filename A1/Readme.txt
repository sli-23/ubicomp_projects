In assignment one, my submission was very late because I got a very bad flu in last week. 
Also, I spent some time in learning a new app development language and the process of this assignment was affected by that.

I tried to meet all requirements in assignment 1 but also meet some challenges:
1. How to get data and test the app. Unlike Android application development, Xcode's simulator cannot manually adjust the sensor data and the only way to emulate data is to use physical devices. This challenge is very easy to solve.
2. While testing the app, I noticed that the shake detection feature lacked sensitivity. I tried to adjust the accelerometerUpdateInterval and it did have improvements.
3. I also tried to do the extra part of the assignment. But when I was testing the app, the step count from HealthKit didn't go up at all. Even with the basic and the improved algorithms, I ran into some issues. Therefore, in consideration of maximum delay time I have to give up this part.

Next time I decided to do Android development instead of iOS development :(
